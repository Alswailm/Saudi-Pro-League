## Overview
This project delves into the intricate relationship between the scheduling of Saudi Football League matches and the observance of daily prayer times across two distinct seasons: 2023/24 and 2024/25. Under the guidance of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, significant changes were made to ensure that the league’s scheduling practices respect the religious and cultural values of the Kingdom.

### "Failing to respect prayer times in scheduling is absolutely unacceptable."  
**– His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud**

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate how the match schedules of the Saudi Football League align with daily prayer times, particularly focusing on the improvements made in the 2024/25 season compared to the 2023/24 season. The project seeks to:
- **Analyze and quantify** the overlap between match times and prayer times.
- **Visualize the impact** of scheduling decisions on the conflict with prayer times.
- **Highlight the positive changes** brought about by the new scheduling practices under the Crown Prince's leadership.

## Data Collection and Processing
### 1. Data Sources
- **Match Times:** Collected from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) for both the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons.
- **Prayer Times:** Gathered from the **Al-Mosally** app, which provides accurate prayer timings for various cities across Saudi Arabia.

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Extraction:** Raw data was extracted from the above-mentioned sources.
- **Cleaning:** The data was meticulously cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors, aligning the prayer times data with the match schedules.
- **Transformation:** The cleaned data was then transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis.

## Analysis and Key Findings
### 2023/24 Season

- **Average Overlap:** The average overlap across these matches was **6.46 minutes**.

### 2024/25 Season
- **Total Matches:** 306
- **Overlap with Prayer Times:** Following the directive of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the scheduling was entirely restructured to avoid any conflict with prayer times.
- **Outcome:** No matches in the 2024/25 season overlapped with prayer times, marking a significant shift in scheduling practices.

## Implications and Significance
This analysis underscores the importance of aligning national sports activities with the cultural and religious values of the Kingdom. The transition from the 2023/24 to the 2024/25 season sets a new benchmark for how sports scheduling can be managed respectfully.

## Conclusion
The project’s findings highlight the substantial progress made in the Saudi Football League’s scheduling practices, demonstrating commitment to respecting religious practices while continuing to grow the sport.
