# **Analysis of Saudi Football League Scheduling in Relation to Prayer Times**

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the scheduling practices in the Saudi Football League, focusing on the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons. The primary objective is to evaluate how well the match schedules align with daily prayer times, reflecting the cultural and religious values of Saudi Arabia. This analysis highlights a significant improvement in scheduling practices under the guidance of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, leading to a more harmonious balance between sports and religious obligations.

## Background
### **2023/24 Season**
The match schedules in this season often conflicted with prayer times. Matches were spread throughout the day, leading to several overlaps with Asr, Maghrib, and Isha prayers. These scheduling decisions likely prioritized broader live streaming rights and global viewership, but they did not fully consider the importance of prayer times, resulting in an average conflict of 6.46 minutes.

### **2024/25 Season**
Responding to the directive of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the league's scheduling practices were revamped to eliminate conflicts with prayer times. Matches were strategically scheduled later in the day, ensuring they did not overlap with prayer times. As a result, the 2024/25 season shows no conflicts with any of the daily prayers, reflecting a deep respect for Saudi Arabia's cultural and religious norms.

## Objective
The project aims to:
1. **Compare the two seasons** to highlight the changes made in scheduling practices.
2. **Quantify the overlap** between match times and prayer times in both seasons.
3. **Visualize the impact** of these scheduling adjustments, showing how the 2024/25 season better respects daily prayer routines.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Match times and prayer times were gathered from "AlMosaly" & "Tranfermaket" for both the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons.
- **Analysis:** The match times were compared against the prayer times for Asr, Maghrib, and Isha to identify any conflicts. These conflicts were quantified in terms of the minutes of overlap.
- **Visualization:** The results were visualized using Power BI, providing clear insights into how the schedules were adjusted from one season to the next.

## Key Findings
- The 2023/24 season had numerous conflicts, with matches often overlapping with prayer times, leading to an average conflict of 6.46 minutes.
- The 2024/25 season successfully eliminated all conflicts, with no matches scheduled during prayer times, demonstrating a thoughtful alignment with cultural and religious practices.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the positive impact of culturally sensitive scheduling practices in the Saudi Football League. The transition from the 2023/24 to the 2024/25 season, guided by the vision of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reflects a commitment to respecting the cultural and religious values of Saudi Arabia while continuing to promote the growth of the sport. The successful alignment of match schedules with prayer times in the 2024/25 season sets a benchmark for future sports scheduling in the region.
